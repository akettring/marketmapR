Description: Heatmaps are a powerful but underappreciated way to visualize timeseries.
This package uses tidyquant to fetch data and ComplexHeatmap to make a clustermap.
Any transformation desired can be applied to the data, from tidyquant or otherwise.
Along the way, timeseries are converted to xts object and NA values are conveniently handled.
